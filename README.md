In this work, I tackle the problem of determining the expected number of pieces generated by $n$ cuts on a round cake. This problem necessitated the creation of a suitable framework and approach, which allowed for many analytical results to be formulated. The contents of this project are found in the document titled Cake_Cutting_Problem_Final.pdf, and the code used to simulate the results is found in CakeCuttingProblem.ipynb. Enjoy reading my solution to this Jane Street problem!
